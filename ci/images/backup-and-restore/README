Unbuild as of 2024/03/28

I have found no evidence for usage of this image in cryo ci. It could be that it is used by "someone"
on the internet but we do not. I'm leaving the Dockerfiles in case we at some point need to
republish this. But from what it looks the only usage is in p-drats tasks.yml used in p-drats
ci. Since that is internal, I guess we can share cryo essentials image with those teams instead.
Leaving the dockerfiles in if someone should require the original images.
